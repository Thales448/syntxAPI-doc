# Quick Start

Welcome to **SyntxAPI** — your gateway to professional-grade, research-ready financial data. This guide will get you up and running in just a few minutes, from authentication to your first real data query.

> **Goal**: Connect to the API, authenticate your key, and retrieve real-time options data.

---

:::tip Getting Started
You'll be up and running in 3 steps: Grab your key, authenticate, and start querying real-time data.
:::

## 🚀 Step 1: Get Your API Key

To begin using SyntxAPI, you'll need an API key. It should have been sent to your email address after registration. 

- Please allow up to **30 minutes** for processing.
- Didn't get one? [Request a new API key](#) here.

---

:::info What is an Access Token?
SyntxAPI uses a token-based authentication system. Your API key generates a single-use token that must be attached to all future requests.
:::

## 🔐 Step 2: Authenticate Your API Key

Use your API key to generate an **access token**. This token must be included in the headers of every API request.

> ⚠️ **One token per key** — generating a new token will revoke the previous one.

### Authentication Request

Replace `<API_KEY>` with your actual key:

**Browser**:
```bash
https://api.syntxapp.com/auth?<API_KEY>
```

**Terminal (curl)**:
```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.syntxapp.com/auth?<API_KEY>'
```

### Example Response
```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6..."
}
```

---

:::caution Remember
If you request a new token, any previously issued token will be **revoked**.
:::

## 📈 Step 3: Send Your First Request

Once you have your token, you're ready to query live market data.

### 🧪 Example: Retrieve AAPL Options Expiring This Week

:::tip Supported Languages
The following examples use Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and C#. More languages coming soon!
:::

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.syntxapp.com/api/v1/current/options/quote"
params = {
    "symbol": "AAPL",
    "expiration": "20240404"
}
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer {TOKEN}",
    "Accept": "application/json"
}

response = requests.get(url, params=params, headers=headers)
print(response.json())
```

### Expected Output
A JSON dictionary containing real-time bid/ask prices, volumes, open interest, and implied volatility for AAPL options expiring on 2024-04-04.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- ✅ Make sure your token is set in the `Authorization` header.
- 🕵️ Check that your API key hasn’t expired or been revoked.
- 📘 See the [Full API Reference](#) and [Request Guide](#) for advanced usage.

---

## ✅ Next Steps

Now that you're authenticated and querying, try exploring other endpoints:

- `/chain` for full option chains
- `/historical` for archived tick-level data
- `/greeks` for delta, gamma, theta, vega
- `/stats` for volume, volatility, and more

Happy querying! 🎯
